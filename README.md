This project dataset are retrieved from Kaggle competition, the goal is to predict future sales for the stores from Walmart.

This project seeks to address the following question: Using historical sales data, what will be the weekly sales for the coming nine months for the 45 stores and 99 departments respectively?

Through comparison of different time series models, machine learning regression models and neural network models using different performance metrics (MAE, WMAE, MSE, and RSME). The best performer would be used to predict future sales for Walmart.

The whole project are written under Jupyter Notebook, therefore user could just open the notebook and view the results easily.
