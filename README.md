This project dataset are retrieved from Kaggle competition, this project seeks to address the following question:

With the use of regression models, does the prediction of sales become more accurate than traditional timeseries methods?

By computing time series methods: Auto Regressor (AR), Moving Average (MA), Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), and Holt-Wintersâ€™ Method (HW). Then, regression methods, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. All of the mentioned above methods would be compare against Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For the calculation of algorithms, Python in Jupyter Notebook would be used. The best model would be used to predict future sales.



The whole project are written under Jupyter Notebook, therefore user could just open the notebook and view the results easily.
